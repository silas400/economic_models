            </div>
            <div class="back">
                <p>Socialism means the major services—like energy, transportation, healthcare, and education—are run for the public rather than by a few private owners. The goal is to keep essentials such as food, water, heat, medical care, and schooling affordable for everyone. People vote or work together to set the rules. There can still be private businesses, but the “big stuff” is managed collectively. It can make life fairer, though changes may be slower because many voices shape the plans.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="back">
                <p>Think of capitalism like a busy swap meet. People own homes and tools, decide what to make, and set prices based on what buyers want. When many customers want a thing, its price tends to rise; when few do, it falls. This push and pull motivates faster ideas and better products. But most countries also set simple rules to stop cheating and big monopolies, helping fairness and safety for families. For all.</p>

                <p>Think of socialism as sharing some big things while still letting people own small stuff. The goal is less gap between rich and poor and more say for workers in big jobs. Communism goes further, aiming for everyone to own nothing privately and a strong central plan. In practice, communist systems focused power in one party and tried to direct most work from the top, which many people found rigid and hard to live with.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="back">
                <p>Think of a mixed economy as a healthy mix of private choices and a helping hand from government. People can own businesses and buy what they want, but the government steps in to prevent big harms and share costs for things like healthcare or schools. It tries to keep prices fair, protect workers, and fix big market problems. Pure extremes rarely fit real life, so most countries use this middle path. That blend lets people chase ideas while keeping safety nets in place.</p>

            <div class="back">
                <p>Think of mixed market capitalism as a bike with two wheels. The market rewards new ideas and hard work. The government helps with basics like education and health care. Together they push growth and fair pay while guarding people from big risks. Pure socialism often lacks innovation and markets alone can miss caring for people. The mix keeps ideas flowing and helps everyone share in growth.</p>

            <div class="back">
                <p>Happiness in a country grows when they mix smart markets with real help for people. People feel safe because jobs exist and prices stay fair. The government pays for doctors, teachers, and care for old or sick neighbors. Clean rules cut corruption and speed up services. When you can trust schools, health care, and a good job, life feels steadier and easier day to day. That mix keeps life steady year after year and helps families plan ahead.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="back">
                <p>Socialism is about sharing the big stuff a nation owns, like power grids, water systems, and big factories. It does not mean the government runs every tiny detail. Some versions let workers own and run companies, others keep big services like utilities in public hands. Many welfare ideas sit inside capitalism too. The key is making big decisions closer to people, with democratic, local control rather than one ruler.</p>

                <p>Socialism isn't one idea. It sits on a wide line from mild tweaks to full government control. Think of a town deciding how buses, schools and jobs are run. Social democracy keeps a market economy but adds strong rules and big safety nets. Democratic socialism wants real public say over big choices and more public ownership. State socialism puts major industries under government planning, not markets. All are paths from market focus to planned control.</p>

                <p>U.S. inequality is higher than peers and slows growth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="back">
                <p>In a largely capitalist system like the U.S., more income flows to high earners who tend to save rather than spend, which weakens everyday demand and slows growth. When spending drops, businesses sell less and hire less, matching studies showing 2–4 percentage-point losses when income shifts upward. OECD data highlight wide gaps in purchasing power, pushing some Americans to want a slightly more social-style balance of protections and safety nets without abandoning capitalism.</p>

            <div class="back">
                <p>People in the United States hold steady views on two big ideas: capitalism and socialism. In 2025 about 54% said capitalism is a good fit for how the country runs, while 39% said socialism is a good fit. Back in 2022, 57% liked capitalism and 36% liked socialism. So, over several years, most Americans keep favoring capitalism more than socialism, with only modest changes. This helps explain debates on jobs, prices, and growth in daily life.</p>

There is no single best system; each shows value based on what people want.</p>
